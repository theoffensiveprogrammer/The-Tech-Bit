<strong> Reviews: </strong>
We are a new technology website that is focused on making technolgy as enjoyable as it 
can possibly be to anyone who visits The Tech Bit.  We try our best to go in depth in all of our
reviews yet we have the system simplified to where if you are in a hurry you can simply look over the 
pros, cons, and bottom line of the review.

<strong> About Us: </strong>



At The Tech Bit we think that you should know that we arent in fact robots or mindless zombies.  
So I inroduce myself I will refer to myself I am a programmer fluent in HTML and 
Objective C.   I also know a few things about computer hardware.  Than we have my awesome friend 
who is a programmer fluent in C++.  He also knows quite a bit about Apple although we 
aren't biased to any brand we do have preferences.

At Tech Bit we believe is original content but in all honesty he can't cover everything.  Here are
some sources that we feel we will be referring back to now and again.  These are also websites that 
we strive to one day be like!
