<strong>iPad 3 first impressions: </strong>
<p>This is my first impressions of the iPad 3rd generation.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The new iPad looks similar to the last generation iPad.</li>
	<li>The iPad has a very beautiful screen that makes it a pleasure to use</li>
	<li>Upon turning on the device I almost instantly notice that the device seems
	quicker</li>
	<li>Finally the new camera does not dissapoint although using it on a daily basis
	is still out of the question</li>
	</ol>
	<p> So there is my initial impressions of the new iPad.  There will be a full review 
	as soon as I feel I have spent enough time with the device to make a judgement.</p>
